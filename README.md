# This Doesnt Exist Tools
Tools for working with the "this doesn't exist" websites
These scripts have a dependency on the command 'uuid' -- they will attempt to find the command and prompt the user if the command needs to be installed on the system.
After cloning this repo, run 'chmod a+x getcat' and 'chmod a+x getperson' to set execute permissions, then move the files into '/usr/bin' or '/usr/local/bin' (so they are in your PATH).
When in any folder just run the command 'getcat' or 'getperson' to download a random image of a cat/person that doesn't actually exist.
Enjoy!
